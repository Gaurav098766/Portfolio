### Packages Used:
i) React smooth scrolling -  We will use This package to scroll from one section to another section when user clicks on the navbar.

ii) Typewriting effect - We will use this package to add different types of writing effects to our app.

iii) React slick slider -  We will use this package for our testimonial section where we will show a list of testimonials in the slider. We will also make sure that our slider is responsive to any device.

iv) React toastify - To show toast messages to our users when they send emails from the contact form.

v) Back-to-top scroll - This package will be used for scroll-to-top features. In a single-page web app, we have many sections on one page. Therefore when our user scrolls to the last section of the page the user again needs to scroll to reach the top section. To solve this problem we will use back-to-scroll features so that they can just click on the button and then it automatically goes to the top section.

vi) React reveal - This package will help us to show animation for each item. You will learn how to add animation for any fields in your react js app.

vii) React Vertical Timeline Component - To show work experience and education we will use a vertical timeline component with animation and custom design.
